"""Verify that every `department:skill` reference resolves, in the docs and in the skills.

Prose naming specific skills rots as skills are renamed or consolidated — and this repository
has already consolidated once, losing six capabilities in the process. A reference to a skill
that no longer exists is a broken promise to a reader, and nothing else in the tree catches it.

Skill bodies are checked as well as the documentation, per D32. They were unchecked until then,
and four of the references inside them were already broken — including one pointing at a skill
that had never existed. Skill files are where readers follow references from most, so the
argument for checking the docs applies to them with more force, not less.

Only tokens whose prefix is a real department directory are checked, so ordinary prose with a
colon in it is ignored rather than guessed at.
